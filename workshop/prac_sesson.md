## Practical sesson: How to write your own modules

Note that all participants should be able to access to the NCI Virtual Desktop environment from their laptop. 
See [here](https://github.com/CWSL/cwsl-mas/wiki/Connecting-to-the-CWSLab) for instructions.

This practical session then goes through [the process](https://github.com/CWSL/cwsl-mas/wiki/Adding-modules) in detail

#### Task 1: Fork CWSLab Workflow Tool 

Instructions [here](https://github.com/CWSL/cwsl-mas/wiki/Installation):
* Create a GitHub account
* Setup ssh keys


#### Task 2: Configure vistrails

Instructions [here](https://github.com/CWSL/cwsl-mas/wiki/Configuration):


#### Task 3: Write a module 

Instructions [here](https://github.com/CWSL/cwsl-mas/wiki/Adding-modules):
  * Participants should pick a simple module like a bash script that implements `cdo trend` or `cdo mul/add/sub/divc`. 
  * Along the way they will be introduced to basic GitHub usage and will submit a pull request for their new module which I will review on the spot.
